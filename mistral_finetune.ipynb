    "# Fine-tuning Mistral 7B using QLoRA 🤙\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and tutorial, we will fine-tune the [Mistral 7B](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-src) model - which outperforms Llama 2 13B on all tested benchmarks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Watch an accompanying video walk-through (but for using your own data) [here](https://youtu.be/kmkcNVvEz-k?si=Ogt1wRFNqYI6zXfw&t=1)!** If you'd like to see that notebook instead, click [here](https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/blob/main/mistral-finetune-own-data.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will use QLoRA, a fine-tuning method that combines quantization and LoRA. For more information about what those are and how they work, see [this post](https://brev.dev/blog/how-qlora-works).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will load the large model in 4bit using `bitsandbytes` (`Mistral-7B-v0.1`) and use LoRA to train using the PEFT library from Hugging Face 🤗.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you ever have trouble importing something from Huggingface, you may need to run `huggingface-cli login` in a shell. To open a shell in Jupyter Lab, click on 'Launcher' (or the '+' if it's not there) next to the notebook tab at the top of the screen. Under \"Other\", click \"Terminal\" and then run the command.\n",

    "#### Before we begin: A note on OOM errors\n",
    "\n",
    "If you get an error like this: `OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory`, tweak your parameters to make the model less computationally intensive. I will help guide you through that in this guide, and if you have any additional questions you can reach out on the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/y9428NwTh3) or on [X](https://x.com/harperscarroll).\n",
    "\n",
    "To re-try after you tweak your parameters, open a Terminal ('Launcher' or '+' in the nav bar above -> Other -> Terminal) and run the command `nvidia-smi`. Then find the process ID `PID` under `Processes` and run the command `kill [PID]`. You will need to re-start your notebook from the beginning. (There may be a better way to do this... if so please do let me know!)"
